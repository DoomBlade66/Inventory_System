---Inventory System---

This is a basic inventory system I made in GameMaker Sudio 2 with the goal of showing how they work,
as well as give people a feel for inventory, and how to manage it. Just like the
license says, this is under the MIT license, so it can be used freely for even commercial use.

Also, credit to [Peter Milko](https://petermilko.itch.io/) for most of the assets in the example project(I suck at art).
